# ChatGPT Diffusion Model Project

## What's This About?
Ever wondered if you could just describe something and see it come to life in a picture? That's what I've been working on! I combined ChatGPT with a cool image-making model to do just that.

## Cool Stuff in This Project
- **ChatGPT's Brainpower**: I used ChatGPT to understand what you're saying.
- **Creating Pictures from Words**: There's this high-tech model that turns your words into images.
- **You Play a Part**: You type in stuff, and the words turn into pictures.

## Behind the Scenes
- **Python Power**: Built everything using Python. PyTorch helps with the heavy lifting for the AI part.
- **Some Handy Tools**: I wrote some extra code ('utils.py') to make everything work together smoothly.
- **Notebook Style**: Put all of this in a Jupyter Notebook so it's easy to play around with.

## Wrapping Up
This project is my dive into mixing words and pictures using AI. It's about exploring new ways to be creative with technology.
